## üöÄ Quick Start - How to Invoke Agents

### Method 1: Explicit Invocation (Recommended)

Ask Claude Code directly to use a specific agent:

```
"Use the code-reviewer agent to review my latest changes"
"Ask the debugger agent to investigate this error"
"Have the security-auditor check for vulnerabilities"
```

### Method 2: Automatic Invocation

Claude Code will automatically invoke relevant agents when it detects appropriate tasks:

- Making code changes ‚Üí `code-reviewer` may be invoked
- Encountering errors ‚Üí `debugger` may be invoked
- Performance issues ‚Üí `performance-engineer` may be invoked

### Method 3: Parallel Execution (Fastest)

Run multiple agents simultaneously for comprehensive review:

```
"Use code-reviewer, security-auditor, and qa-expert in parallel to review this PR"
```

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Quality Gates

**Before committing:**
```
"Use code-reviewer and security-auditor in parallel"
```

**Before deploying:**
```
"Use code-reviewer, security-auditor, and qa-expert in parallel"
```

### 2. Use Parallel Execution for Speed

**‚ùå Slow (Sequential):**
```
"Use code-reviewer to review, then security-auditor, then qa-expert"
```
**Time**: ~180 seconds

**‚úÖ Fast (Parallel):**
```
"Use code-reviewer, security-auditor, and qa-expert in parallel"
```
**Time**: ~60 seconds (67% time savings!)

### 3. Be Specific About Scope

**‚ùå Vague:**
```
"Review my code"
```

**‚úÖ Specific:**
```
"Use code-reviewer to review src/lib/leave-eligibility-service.ts focusing on the seniority calculation logic"
```

### 4. Leverage Agent Expertise

Each agent has specialized knowledge. Use the right tool for the job:

- **Database issues** ‚Üí `database-optimizer` or `postgres-pro`
- **TypeScript errors** ‚Üí `typescript-pro`
- **Next.js patterns** ‚Üí `nextjs-developer`
- **Security concerns** ‚Üí `security-auditor`
- **Performance issues** ‚Üí `performance-engineer`
- **Testing needs** ‚Üí `qa-expert`

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Agent Not Found

**Error**: "I don't see an agent named [agent-name]"

**Solution**: Ensure the agent file exists in `.claude/agents/` and restart Claude Code.

### Issue 2: Slow Performance

**Problem**: Agent takes too long to respond

**Solution**:
- Use parallel execution for multiple agents
- Be specific about scope to reduce analysis time
- Check token budget (agents use ~15k tokens each)

### Issue 3: Agent Not Invoked Automatically

**Problem**: Claude Code doesn't automatically use the right agent

**Solution**: Explicitly invoke the agent:
```
"Use the [agent-name] agent to [task]"
```

### Issue 4: Conflicting Recommendations

**Problem**: Multiple agents give different advice

**Solution**:
- Prioritize security and correctness over other concerns
- Use `code-reviewer` as the final authority on code quality
- Cross-reference with Air Niugini project standards (CLAUDE.md)
