## ❌ Unresolved Critical Issue

### Missing Environment Variable in Vercel Production

**Issue**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` not active in production environment

**Current Status**: **UNRESOLVED** after multiple troubleshooting attempts

**Symptoms**:
- Browser console shows: `❌ URL: true ServiceKey: false`
- Cache warm-up failing: `❌ Cache warm-up failed: Error: Supabase configuration missing`
- Admin operations degraded

**Impact**:
- ❌ Cache warm-up failing (performance degraded)
- ❌ Admin operations limited
- ✅ User authentication working (uses anon key)
- ✅ Basic queries working
- ✅ Application fully functional for end users

**Troubleshooting Attempts**:

1. **Attempt 1**: Added variable to Vercel
   - Result: Still showing `hasServiceKey: false`

2. **Attempt 2**: Corrected environment scope from "All Environments" to "Production"
   - Result: **STILL showing `hasServiceKey: false`**

3. **Latest Test (23:45 UTC)**: Production site still failing
   - Cache warm-up errors persist
   - Environment variable not being detected

**Required Variable**:
```
Name: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6IndnZG1ndm9ucXlzZmx3ZGlpb2xzIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTU4MjMyMCwiZXhwIjoyMDcxMTU4MzIwfQ.byfbMS__aOJzhhty54h7ap3XK19f9-3Wu7S-ZWWV2Cg
Environment: Production (NOT "All Environments")
```

**Next Steps Required**:

1. **Verify Vercel Dashboard Configuration**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Confirm `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is listed
   - Verify it shows "Production" (not "All Environments")
   - Verify the value starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...`

2. **Check Latest Deployment**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
   - Verify latest deployment shows "Ready" status
   - Check deployment timestamp (should be recent)
   - Review deployment logs for any errors

3. **Force Redeploy** (if variable is correct):
   - In Vercel Deployments tab
   - Find latest deployment
   - Click three dots (...) → Redeploy
   - Select "Redeploy with existing build cache"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for propagation

4. **Test Production Site**:
   - Open: https://www.pxb767office.app
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for: `✅ Cache warm-up completed successfully`
   - Should NOT see: `❌ Missing Supabase environment variables`

5. **Hard Refresh Browser** (after redeploy):
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+F5
   - Mac: Cmd+Shift+R
   - This clears cached JavaScript

**Alternative Debug Steps**:

If the above doesn't work, check:
- Is the variable name EXACTLY `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (case-sensitive)?
- Is there a typo in the variable value?
- Are there any trailing spaces or newlines in the value?
- Is the deployment actually for the Production environment?
- Check Vercel deployment logs for environment variable errors

## Overall Assessment

### What's Working (12/13 Tests) ✅

The October 6, 2025 deployment is **functionally complete** with all user-requested features working correctly:

- ✅ Custom domain operational with valid SSL
- ✅ All Roster Planning terminology updates verified
- ✅ Leave type labels correct in web UI and PDFs
- ✅ Request date column present with proper formatting
- ✅ PDF reports have correct titles and filenames
- ✅ Authentication and authorization functioning
- ✅ Database connectivity and RLS policies active
- ✅ MCP servers (both Supabase and shadcn) operational
- ✅ Application fully functional for end users

### What Needs Attention (1/13 Tests) ⚠️

**Single Issue**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable not active in Vercel production

**User Impact**:
- Minimal - End users can use all features
- Performance slightly degraded (no cache)
- Admin operations limited

**Fix Required**:
- Verify Vercel dashboard configuration
- Ensure variable is set to "Production" environment
- Redeploy and test
- Should take 5-10 minutes once correctly configured

---

## Recommendation

**For Production Use**: The application is **safe to use** as-is. All core functionality works correctly.

**For Optimal Performance**: Resolve the environment variable issue to enable:
- Cache warm-up for faster page loads
- Full admin operations
- Optimal server-side performance

**Priority**: Medium - Fix when convenient, not urgent
